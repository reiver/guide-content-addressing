# GUIDE: Content Addressing

by [Charles Iliya Krempeaux](http://changelog.ca/)

---

This is a **guide** on **content addressing**.

## Preface

**Content Addressing** is something that points to _what_ or _who_ is wanted, rather than pointing to _where_ or _when_ something is or happened (which is what _Location Addressing_ is about).

## Prerequisites

Before you attempt this guide you should first understand **hashing**, **hash functions**, and **digests** â€” one way to learn those is with my [hashing guide](https://github.com/reiver/guide-hashing). If you don't already understand **hashing**, **hash functions**, and **digests**, then go learn what is at that guide first, and then come back here.
